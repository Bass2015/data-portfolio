    "## An introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Beatiful Soup (in its latest version, BS4) is a well known and wide used Python library, very useful to scrape data from websites. Although there are more advanced tools, BS4 is still one of the first choices among data analysts when they need to gather information. \n",
    "\n",
    "I won't bore you with more text that you can find anywhere in the internet, so let's go with the explanation. If you wanna follow along, you'll need to install the `requests` library, and (obviously) BeatifulSoup. We can make the example a bit more real by using `pandas` at the end, so we can see where would be normally go once we scraped some data. You can do that from the command line or terminal:\n",

    "### A bit of previous thinking\n",
    "\n",
    "~~Normally~~ Ideally, before starting any project, we should sit down and think a bit how will we structure the code: What functionality do I need? How will I write the code? How can I make the code reusable? Those are questions worth asking, they will save a lot of time (and headaches) in the future. Fortunately for you, I've already done that. I'll roughly explain what every section does, and we'll go in detail below. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will divide the code in different methods, so we can reuse parts of them. Another advantage is that the code will be more readable, something that our colleagues (or ourselves in the future) will thank.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, let's think what things do we want to do with the code, from the more generic to the more specific:\n",
    "- Ultimately, we want to retrieve a list of jackets, with their prices and other characteristics:\n",
    "  \n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    def get_jackets():\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "    ```\n",

    "    def get_jacket_tags():\n",
    "        pass\n",

    "- The method above will take a url and use Beatiful Soup to find all the tags we need. But for that we need a parsed html:\n",

    "    ```python\n",
    "    def get_parsed_html(url):\n",
    "        pass\n",

    "    def tag_to_dict_jacket(node):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "    ```\n",

    "Here is when things start to get interesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we have to choose something to study. In this example, we're gonna look at the prices and other information of different mountain gear jackets from [Oliunid](https://www.oliunid.com). We write two variables where we save the urls from which we're gonna gather the information. Because the site has many jackets saved in different pages, we need the second url to iterate through them. We're gonna use that later, for now, let's save the parsed html in a variable.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    first_page = \"https://www.oliunid.com/clothing-for-climbing/men-s-climbing-clothing/men-s-climbing-jackets.html\"\n",
    "    other_pages = \"https://www.oliunid.com/clothing-for-climbing/men-s-climbing-clothing/men-s-climbing-jackets.html?p={}\"\n",
    "    html = get_parsed_html(first_page)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The magic happens: `find_all`\n",
    "The parsed html that BS4 has provided us comes with a bunch of handy methods. One of the most comonly used is `find_all` [(read the docs)](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#find-all). With this function, we cand find all the tags in a html document that match a certain selection, and we can use the tag's attributes to specify our search.\n",
    "\n",
    "And now the important part. How do I know where is the information of the jackets? Very easy, right click on one of the jackets and then click in 'Inspect' (or Inspeccionar in spanish).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='./images/inspect.png' width=25% height=25% \n",
    "    style=\"display: block; \n",
    "           border-radius: 20px;\n",
    "           margin-left: auto;\n",
    "           margin-right: auto;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "A tab opens, normally to the right. There we can see the html file of that webpage, with all the tags, attributes and information. Hovering the mouse over the tags will highlight the element in the webpage, so we can identify what do we need. In this case we need the a `div` tag with a `class` attribute with value \"product details product-item-details\".\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='./images/mouse-hover.png' width=65% height=65%\n",
    "    style=\"display: block; \n",
    "           border-radius: 20px;\n",
    "           margin-left: auto;\n",
    "           margin-right: auto;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the only thing left is use the `find_all` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    jacket_tags = html.find_all('div', {'class' : 'product details product-item-details'})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How many pages?\n",
    "Once we have the jackets from the first page, now we want to iterate through the rest of the pages and do the same. But, how many pages do we have? When exploring the site, we can see that, for example, there are 3 pages. But that might change in the future, when we actually run all the code. The best way to do this is to actually extract that information from the website. At the bottom, we can see a text saying \"Page 1 of 3\". We already know how to see the html element that corresponds to this text. If we inspect the element, we can see that this text is in a `span` tag that's inside a `li` tag with a class attribute with value 'item summary'. We say that `span` is a *child* of `li`.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='./images/pages.png' width=65% height=65%\n",
    "    style=\"display: block; \n",
    "           border-radius: 20px;\n",
    "           margin-left: auto;\n",
    "           margin-right: auto;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we want only one tag. The method `find` does exactly the same as find_all: it goes through all the document and returns the first occurence of what we're looking for. The following line is almost the same as the one where we described `find_all`. The only difference is that we're accesing the child of the returned tag with the syntax `.[child]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    summary = html.find('li', {'class': 'item summary'}).span\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But if we see what's in this variable, we see the whole tag: \n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "    <span>Page 1 of 3</span>\n",
    "```\n",
    "We only need the content of the tag. We can do this simply writing `summary.string`. After that, we take only the last character (the total number of pages) and cast it to an integer to use it in a for loop later.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    pages = int(summary.string[-1])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Extending the list of jacktes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This one is easy. If we make a call to `type(jacket_tags)` we'll see that it is an instance of `bs4.element.ResultSet`. This is a BS4 class that inherits from `list`, we can use the `extend` method to add the jackets from the other pages, now that we know how many pages do we have. We wrap it in a for loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(2,pages):\n",
    "        html = get_parsed_html(other_pages.format(i))\n",
    "        jacket_tags.extend(\n",
    "            html.find_all(\n",
    "                'div', \n",
    "                {'class' : 'product details product-item-details'}\n",
    "            )\n",
    "        )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Buff, finally... The whole method ends up like this:"

We can access to an attribute's content with the syntax `node[attribute_name]`.\n",

    "Oh, no! We get an error! Reading through the error prompt we see that `old_price` is a `NoneType` object. That's because the `find` method returns None when it doesn't find what we're looking for, and we haven't add anything to the code to handle this error. Let's be conservative, and asume that any of the tags that we want could be missing. There are some elegant ways to handle this errors (see [try except syntax](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html) in Python), but let's just do it fast and dirty. We will add an if statement to see if we have a NoneType and, in that case, we'll asign a `None` to that position in the dictionary. Later we can use pandas to handle those nones.\n",

    "Well, here we see one of our \"`None`s\", among other things (like the third jacket having a price of $0, what a deal!). We could keep investigating the dataframe now, to see if the only missing values are the old price values. In that case, we could retweak the code to save the currency from the final price instead, and maybe we could asign the final price to the old price as well (having no discount). We could also process the currency (pass the symbol to USD), and separate the brand in two fields (brand and model). If we do all those things while we are saving the info, our data will be much cleaner, thus much easier to handle. \n",
